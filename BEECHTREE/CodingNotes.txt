Notes Dec 21:

-Code for thermal tracking partially complete (working in "processBEECHTREEcolonyFodler"
	-assumption currently is that there's one folder with stationary cameras (so one tform object to translate between cameras that works for all files)
	
	
TO DO:
	-add in function in the beginning to add in metadata
		-Introduce temperature data (figure out what format this should be in, and how to reconcile current multiple forms!
		-manually identify ROIs for temperature probes (once for colony, perhaps provide visual that these work across all trials?
		-Incorporate option to mark locations of brood and food pots? Does this have to be separate for each trial? adapt from old code
